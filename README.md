# FizzBuzz Task

This program is in python and prints the FizzBuzz sequence between a given start and end value. It follows the FizzBuzz rules where:
- If a number is divisible by 3, it prints "Fizz"
- If a number is divisible by 5, it prints "Buzz"
- If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz"
- Otherwise, it just prints that number

## Usage

To use the FizzBuzz program, follow these steps:

1. Install Python (if not already installed) from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org](https://www.python.org)

2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. Open terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the FizzBuzz program files called `source.py`

4. Run the `main.py` file using the Python interpreter:

   python main.py
   

5. Enter the start and end values in this fizz_buzz function. The program will print the FizzBuzz sequence between the given values.

## Testing
I did pytesting and made tthree use cases as follows:


Test case 1:

Description: Testing a normal sequence
Expected Output: [Expected output here]


Test case 2:

Description: Testing negative input values
Expected Error: ValueError: Either of the input values are negative

Test case 3:

Description: Testing non-integer input values
Expected Error: TypeError: Only integers are allowed


## Example

Here's an example usage of the FizzBuzz program:


$ python main.py
import source
source.fizzbuzz(1,50)
1

In this example, the program prints the FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to 50 according to the FizzBuzz rules.
